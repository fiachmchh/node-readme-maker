    # Author : Fiach McHugh-Hill

    ## Description :
    The aim of this project was to build a readme generator through node whereby the user would be asked a series of questions and when answered, the app would generate a project readme.

    Important lessons learnt building this app included learning how to use the nocde module system, installing required files through npm and calling them as well as learning how to use .gitignore for pushing to github.

    This project is ideal for anyone wishing to create a readme for any app that they build.
